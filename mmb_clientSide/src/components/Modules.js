				content:
					"There is a quote that says “Building a fortress before the storm is wiser than rebuilding after the fury”. Anyways, our mindset has been quite different about healthcare. We take medicines more easily than putting efforts on exercise and diet. But mental health is in an even more alarming situation, where people do not open up quickly. Preventive mental health care lays down guidelines to help you prevent your minor problems from becoming a larger mental health condition like depression, panic attacks, etc. It is a way to understand how the human mind interacts with the world.",

				content:
					"Indians have lived a long era believing that mental health issues were caused not by hormonal imbalances or trauma-related incidents, but by the curse of God. That gave power to the Indian Babas to fool around. However, as the country is progressing, we are being more aware of the cause of mental illness, and the conditions when it becomes necessary to approach a mental health therapist. Preventive care is applicable for stress, anxiety, panic, low mood and similar issues, but you must visit a psychiatrist is you have symptoms of schizophrenia (though psychiatrists are hardly able to cure it), or to a surgeon in case of physiological issues like brain haemorrhage or damage due to accident.",
